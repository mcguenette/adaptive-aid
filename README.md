## Adaptive Aid

Adaptive Aid is a website offering services to those seeking assistance with mental health and/or disability.

This project was created to practice web development. We made use of our knowledge of 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Markdown.



### Challenges faced 
* conflict involving choice of class names
* learning about merge conflicts



### Future Features
* More product pages
* Create an About Us page
* Create a Contact Us page
* Complete form for booking consultations



### Modal Feature
We created a modal for our page and while it was a little challenging at first, the overall product and the way it enhanced our page made it worth it. See here an image of our modal. ![](./assets/img/modalscreenshot.png)

To achieve this we used the following JavaScript code.
```javascript
// Modal
select('#open-modal-btn').onclick = function() {
    select('#modal').style.display = 'flex';
    select('#modal').style.alignItems = 'center';
};
  
document.getElementsByClassName('close')[0].onclick = function() {
    select('#modal').style.display = 'none';
};

  // Close the modal if the overlay is clicked
  window.onclick = function(event) {
    if (event.target == select('#modal')) {
      select('#modal').style.display = 'none';
    }
  };
```

### Plans Automatic Scroll
To add some sophestication to our page we decied to add a button that when clicked will automatically send the user to a designated section of the page. See below a screenshot of the page. ![](./assets/img/ourplansscreenshot.png)

To do this we used JavaScript as seen below.
```javascript
// Click and scroll to section --- broken if utility functions are used
const plansSection = document.getElementById('plans');
const plansButton = document.getElementById('plans-btn');

 plansButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    plansSection.scrollIntoView({
        behavior: 'auto',
        block: 'start',
        inline: 'nearest'
      });
  });
```
